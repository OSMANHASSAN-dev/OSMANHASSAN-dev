For your actual visits, you would typically use a dynamic visitor badge from a service like "Visitor Badge" or "GitHub Profile Views" which you'd embed using an image URL. If you have a specific visitor count you'd like to hardcode for now, please provide it. Otherwise, this line is a placeholder mimicking the example's visual placement.)*
